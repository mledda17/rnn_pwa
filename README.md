## 📝 Abstract
> This paper proves the exact equivalence between ReLU-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and discrete-time continuous piecewise-affine (CPWA) dynamical systems. We show that every ReLU–RNN induces a finite polyhedral partition of the state–input space with affine dynamics on each region, and we provide a constructive procedure to derive the corresponding CPWA representation. Conversely, we prove that any CPWA system admits an exact ReLU–RNN realization, although only the existence of such a mapping is established without an explicit construction. The equivalence is numerically validated by comparing the trajectories of a two-layer ReLU–RNN and its corresponding CPWA model, confirming perfect agreement.
